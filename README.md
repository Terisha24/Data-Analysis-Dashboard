## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This repository contains a series of interactive Tableau dashboards and visualizations developed as part of my academic coursework in data analytics and visualization. The assignments used real-world and simulated datasets to apply core principles in exploratory data analysis (EDA), dashboard creation, and storytelling through data.

These projects reflect my ability to:
- Analyze and prepare diverse datasets
- Use Tableau for interactive visualizations
- Apply filters, aggregations, calculated fields, and multiple chart types
- Interpret and communicate insights from public and operational data
