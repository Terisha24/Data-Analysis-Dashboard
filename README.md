## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This repository contains a series of interactive Tableau dashboards and visualizations developed as part of my academic coursework in data analytics and visualization. The assignments used real-world and simulated datasets to apply core principles in exploratory data analysis (EDA), dashboard creation, and storytelling through data.

These projects reflect my ability to:
- Analyze and prepare diverse datasets
- Use Tableau for interactive visualizations
- Apply filters, aggregations, calculated fields, and multiple chart types
- Interpret and communicate insights from public and operational data

## ðŸ“‚ Datasets Used

### A.4 Milligan Chapter 2
- **Wikipedia Pageviews (May 2019 â€“ May 2021)**: Comparative language-based traffic data
- **Metro Systems CSV**: Global metro rail systems by location and system length
- **San Francisco Buildings Energy Report**: Compliance and usage data for city buildings

---

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations Created

- **Bar Charts**: Wikipedia language pageviews, Postal Codes by floor area
- **Scatterplot**: Longitude vs. Metro System Length
- **Filtered Frequency Chart**: 2019 benchmark status violations in San Francisco
- **Circle View Chart**: Buildings by energy audit date and floor area

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

- English Wikipedia had the highest total pageviews from 2019â€“2021.
- San Francisco postal code 94105 had the highest total floor area of buildings violating energy regulations.
- 78 buildings in that postal code failed to meet 2019 energy benchmarks.
- A specific building scheduled for an energy audit in January 2024 had the highest floor area among future audits.
